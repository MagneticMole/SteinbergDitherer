USE:

Run main.py - It will provide you with a file selection dialog. Choose whatever picture you want to dither.

The program will start to apply the dithering effect. Once it is done, a window displaying the picture will appear. You can press 's' to save it to the project home folder or 'ESCAPE' to close the window.
